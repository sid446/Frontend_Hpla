          The LIS professionals in the state worked in bits and pieces since long
          through various informal groups for the establishment of a proper body
          or association that could work for the betterment of LIS professionals
          and library services in Himachal Pradesh. Under the able guidance of
          many professionals of the state and across India, a systematic effort
          was made to formalize the Association.

          The structure and bye-laws of the HPLA were finalized in a meeting
          headed by Prof. A. S Chandel and Shri Prem Chand, which was coordinated
          by Dr. Suresh K Chauhan at Jaypee University of Information Technology,
          Waknaghat, Solan, Himachal Pradesh. A long struggle of library and
          information science professionals of Himachal Pradesh came to an end
          with the establishment of the Himachal Pradesh Library Association
          (HPLA) in 2019.
        </li>
        <li>
          The HPLA was registered under the H.P. Societies Registration Act 2006
          (Act No. 25 of 2006) under the Registration No. 1366/2019 on the 31st
          day of October 2019. The ambition of the Himachal Pradesh Library
          Association (HPLA) is to provide a common forum where LIS professionals
          from the state would develop an understanding of cooperation among
          themselves.

          The HPLA also provides an opportunity to its members to seek technical
          support and guidance in streamlining libraries and library services.
          The HPLA has been primarily formed to improve the life of people
          (children, students, senior citizens, research scholars, authors,
          writers, professionals, etc.) residing in Himachal Pradesh through
          improving the quality of education and research by promoting and
          arranging quality resources in particular state of libraries; library
          professionals and library services by achieving high standards in all
          domains of library and information science, particularly in Himachal
